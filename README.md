# Portfolio Reflection - Hayoung Jeong
Because we are using Bootstrap to build our website, I approached this project very differently from my midterm. Instead of laying down the foundational html before starting any styling, I built and style **each section one at a time**. This is because I was still unfamiliar with how the html would incorporate bootstrap components like a collapsible navigation menu. 

Because of my lack of experience using frameworks and libraries, I found it **difficult to find the exact component or class that I was looking for**. So I started searching on Google to find other resources such as programming forums such as [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was extremely helpful as I could get detailed explanations for specific questions I had that have already been asked.

I also found it challenging to know **when I needed to included things such as aria labels or roles**. Online resources such as [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) often included aria labels and such in their solutions. Seeing how they were used and worded helped me get a better feel for how to implement these accessibility tools. For example having an aria label say "toggle navigation menu" rather than "this button opens the navigation menu".

Overall, I have learned a new way to approach web development and have grown significantly more comfortable with using frameworks, libraries, and accessibility tools.
